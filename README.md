## Design motivation

The website should prioritise accessibility over aesthetics, and be easy to maintain and use.

## How was this built

The Blog and Docs pages are provided by [Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).

As for the Landing, Projects and About pages, I built them using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

## Can I use this

I built this website for my own personal use but you are free to use it as long as you credit me. You can do so by linking back to [evantay.com](https://evantay.com/) :relaxed: Cheers!
